## How to Use This Repository

Browse through the available automations in the repository. Each automation is contained in its own file with a descriptive name. The file starts with a comment block that explains what the automation does, for example:

```javascript
/**
 * This function is triggered when a hacker submits a report. It automates the process of reviewing the report, generating feedback, and sending the feedback to the hacker with a comment.
 */
```
